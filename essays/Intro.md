I decided to major in ITM because I love learning about technology and because it was recommended by a friend. 
He said he enjoyed the class and that it really helped build his foundation as a technology professional. 
The world is shifting into the new area and having a degree in ITM will help me in whatever career path I choose. 
I hope to learn a lot and I am excited to take my first steps in learning ITM.
